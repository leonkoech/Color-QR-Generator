# QR code generator with flask

This is a simple project I created with python flask to generate colorful QR codes based on the text input and the colors selected. <br>
It is my  first flask project and a  continuation to  [this project](https://github.com/leonkoech/QR-code-generator) which is a CLI  program to do the same.

Here's the link to the website. [link](https://qrcodegen-app.herokuapp.com/)
